## Requirements

- Python 3.11
- CUDA-compatible GPU (NVIDIA) or Apple Silicon for best performance
- CPU-only mode is supported but will be significantly slower
- ffmpeg (for M4B creation)

## VibeVoice Model

This application uses [Microsoft VibeVoice](https://github.com/microsoft/VibeVoice) for text-to-speech synthesis.

**What's installed automatically:**
- VibeVoice package (installed from GitHub during setup to include voice files)
- Pre-extracted voice files for 25+ speakers in multiple languages
- The VibeVoice-Realtime-0.5B model (downloaded from HuggingFace on first use)

**Note:** The PyPI vibevoice package doesn't include voice files, so we install directly from GitHub.

Voice prompts are provided in pre-extracted embedded format (.pt files) included with VibeVoice. For custom voice creation, please refer to the VibeVoice documentation.
